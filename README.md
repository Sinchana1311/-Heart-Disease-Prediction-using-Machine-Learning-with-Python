Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

Overview

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient based on various medical attributes.

Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Heart Disease UCI dataset, which includes attributes such as:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Resting ECG
- Maximum Heart Rate
- Exercise Induced Angina
- ST Depression
- Slope of ST Segment
- Number of Major Vessels
- Thalassemia
- Target (0: No Disease, 1: Disease)

Steps Performed

1. Data Loading
2. Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature Selection and Scaling
5. Model Training (Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, etc.)
6. Model Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

Results

The best-performing model was selected based on its accuracy and reliability in predicting heart disease.

How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook file.
2. Ensure all required Python libraries are installed.
3. Run the notebook in Jupyter or any compatible environment.

Note

This project contains only the backend logic and no frontend interface.
